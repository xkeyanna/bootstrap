          <p>
            After receiving a BA from UC Irvine in International Finance, I decided to travel the world. 
            I started by teaching English in Hong Kong and then got hired by American Airlines to work as a flight attendant back in the USA. 
            I began my flight attendant job in New York, went on to Miami, San Francisco, until finally I made it to my hometown, Orange County (now I work at LAX and SNA).<p>
          <p class="dark">
            With a toddler at home, everything is different and I want to gain skills that I can put to work for different businesses of all kinds, without leaving the state, or the country. 
            I have a passion for numbers, logic, and development and I'm overjoyed to be given the change to be a part of your team! 
            Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments, I'd love to hear from you!
